# 📊 Machine Learning Models Repository

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Models Repository** 🚀  
This repository contains implementations of **various Machine Learning algorithms**, built from scratch and using popular libraries like **NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn**, etc.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Understand ML algorithms deeply
- Apply them on real-world datasets
- Compare models using proper evaluation metrics
- Build reusable and production-ready code
